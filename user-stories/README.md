# Airbnb Clone Backend: User Stories

The document lists a set of user stories derived from the Use Case Diagram for the Airbnb Clone Backend project. These stories articulate the system's functionalities from the perspective of different users, defining what they want to achieve and why.

User stories are a powerful tool for:

- **Understanding Requirements:** Clearly outlining what features are needed.
- **Prioritization:** Helping to decide which features to build first.
- **Communication:** Facilitating discussions between development teams and stakeholders.
